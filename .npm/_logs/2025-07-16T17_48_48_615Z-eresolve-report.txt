# npm resolution error report

While resolving: astro-ciberpunk-portfolio@undefined
Found: astro@4.16.18
node_modules/astro
  dev astro@"^4.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer astro@"^2.6.5" from @astrojs/tailwind@4.0.0
node_modules/@astrojs/tailwind
  dev @astrojs/tailwind@"^4.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
